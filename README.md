# django-powered-blog

- These blogs are based on python3-django  
- Simple blogs can be created with proper topic name and details of descriptions  
- Bogs with **text formatting**, **image rendering**, **video* is not supported till now  
- Comments are appreciated  
- Simply a visitor can enter his namr and put a comment in the blog  
- But it will be the ultimate decision of the administrator of the site to determine whether that comment is to be shown to public or not  
- The comments are to be approved or deleted by the owner of the site
- If anyone wish to write a blog, simply ask me, I will give him the administration access.
